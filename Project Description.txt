Step 1 - Data collection and Aggregration
 * Firstly, I have collected the poems dataset from two different websites ie kaggle.com and data.mendeley.com
 * Then, I have selected important columns and then i have merged them into a single dataset Poems.csv
 * Final Dataset have 748 entries.

Step 2 - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
 * Firstly, I have imported all the relevent libraries
 * Then, I have imported the data
 * Then, I have shuffled the data in order to reduce biasness
 * Then, I have done data preprocessing which includes-
   * Removing special characters, puntuations, escape-sequence characters etc.
   * Converting the alphabets into lowercase
   * Tokenization
   * Remove Stopwords
   * Stemming
 * Then, I have split the data into training and testing set
 * Then, I have done Vectorization with CountVectorizer

Step 3 - Modeling
 I have used 2 machine learning models ie. Naive Bayes classifier and Random Forest Classifier
